**Exploratory data analysis: Generate insight of movie genres for Microsoft**

**Introduction**

Microsoft is an American multinational computer technology corporation whose history started 4th April 1975. Formed by Harvard College dropout, Bill Gates and his childhood friend Paul Allen, Microsoft has now become the biggest software company. It is also one of the most valuable companies in the world.Microsoft is engaged in developing, licensing and supporting a range of software products and services catering to different requirements.Although the company recognised that they had a major presence in consumer markets as technology advances.

**Problem Statement**

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

By observing the prevailing box office performance, we can gain valuable insights into audience preferences and tailor our movie production strategy accordingly. These insights will guide decision-making processes.

**Main Objective**

To develop a project for Microsoft exploring what kind of films are currently doing the best at the box office

**Specific Objective**

To conduct exploratory data analysis on the im.db database in order to provide the company with statistical data.By examining the data and applying statistical techniques, we can provide the studio with meaningful recommendations regarding the genres that have the potential to improve their overall quality.

**Data Understanding**

The data being used is from the im.db database in which we are using two tables. Which are :

* movie_basics
* movie_ratings

The "movie_basics" table comprises 146,144 rows and includes six columns. It provides information about various movie attributes such as movie_id, primary_title and original_title, start_year, runtime_minutes and genre.

On the other hand, the "movie_ratings" table contains 73,856 rows and consists of three columns. This table contains data related to the ratings received by the movies, including average rating, number of votes, and movie ID.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, I found out that that documentaries, biographies, music-related films, and sports-themed movies have achieved the highest average ratings. These genres have resonated well with audiences, reflecting their appreciation for storytelling, real-life narratives, and engaging musical. 
Conversely, horror and science have obtained the lowest average ratings. This indicates that these genres may not have resonated as strongly with viewers, suggesting a potential area for improvement in terms of audience reception and satisfaction. By leveraging these insights, the studio can focus on producing more content in the genres that have proven to be well-received, while also considering ways to enhance the quality and appeal of horror and sci-fi films to improve their ratings and audience reception.

**Recommendation**

Based on the analysis, it is recommended that the new Microsoft movie studio focuses on genres such as documentaries, biographies, music, and sports. These genres have consistently received high ratings and have resonated well with audiences. By capitalizing on the audience's preference for factual storytelling, real-life narratives, and engaging content related to music and sports, the studio can increase the likelihood of positive reception and audience satisfaction.

In contrast, the analysis indicates that horror and sci-fi genres have obtained lower ratings. Therefore, it would be prudent for the Microsoft studio to prioritize genres that have demonstrated a higher potential for success, rather than investing heavily in horror or sci-fi films, which may face more challenges in terms of audience reception and satisfaction.

By aligning the studio's content production strategy with genres that have a proven track record of positive ratings, Microsoft can position itself to deliver compelling and well-received films, enhancing its chances of success in the competitive movie industry.
