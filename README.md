The company needs to know what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office therefore  making informed decisions that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


**Main Objective**

By analyzing the prevailing Box Office and IMDB performance, we can have better understanding about audience preferences and tailor our movie production  accordingly. These insights will guide decision-making processes which will result to success of the movie production.

**Specific Objective**

To conduct exploratory data analysis on the im.db database in order to provide the company with statistical data.By examining the data and applying statistical techniques, we can provide the studio with meaningful recommendations regarding the genres that have the potential to improve their overall quality.

**Data Understanding**

The data being used is from the im.db database in which we are using two tables. Which are :

* movie_basics
* movie_ratings

The "movie_basics" table comprises 146,144 rows and includes six columns. It provides information about various movie attributes such as movie_id, primary_title and original_title, start_year, runtime_minutes and genre.

On the other hand, the "movie_ratings" table contains 73,856 rows and consists of three columns. This table contains data related to the ratings received by the movies, including average rating, number of votes, and movie ID.

**Conclusion**


Both BV Studio and P/DW Studio achieved the highest gross earnings. BV Studio earned more domestically, while P/DW Studio earned more from foreign markets.
**Recommendation**

The new Microsoft movie studio should prioritize genres such as documentaries, biographies, music, and sports, since these have  high ratings and audiences will get satisfaction.

* The new studio should try and borrow the strategy from both BV and P/DW studios since they have highest earnings and this will ensure the success of the new studio.
